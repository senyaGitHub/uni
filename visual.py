def generate_passengers_per_class_visual(passengers_per_class_counts):
    """
    Task: Generate a horizontal bar graph.

    The function should take a parameter that contains the number of passengers that travelled
    1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class.

    The function should generate a horizontal bar graph showing the ratio of passengers that
    travelled 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class.

    For example, if we have 200 passengers where 50 travelled first class, 30 travelled 2nd class, and
    20 travelled third class, then the following string would be generated:

    1st class | ⌧⌧⌧⌧⌧
    2nd class | ⌧⌧⌧
    3rd class | ⌧⌧

    :param passengers_per_class_counts: The number of 1st, 2nd and 3rd class passengers
    :return: A string containing a horizontal bar graph
